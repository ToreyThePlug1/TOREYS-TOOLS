Custom Instructions to Set Up Your Discord Server with the Bot
Step 1: Create a New Discord Server
Open Discord: Log into your Discord account.
Create a New Server:
Click the plus icon + on the left-hand side of the Discord app (server list).
Select "Create My Own".
Name your server (e.g., "Weed & Gaming Community").
Choose your server region if prompted.
Click "Create".
Step 2: Invite the Bot to Your Server
Get the Bot's Invite Link:
Use the bot's invite link (provided by the developer or generated through the Discord Developer Portal).
Invite the Bot:
Click on the invite link.
Select the server you just created from the dropdown menu.
Ensure the necessary permissions are granted to the bot (such as Manage Channels, Manage Roles, etc.).
Click "Authorize" and complete any CAPTCHA if prompted.
Step 3: Set Up the Server Using the Bot
Check if the Bot is Online:

Once invited, you should see the bot appear in the member list of your server.
Ensure the bot's status is "Online."
Initiate the Server Setup:

In any text channel (like #general), type the command to start setting up the server.
Command: !setup_server
Example: !setup_server
Watch the Magic Happen:

After entering the command, the bot will begin creating the various categories and channels specified in the server setup script.
This includes channels for different cannabis strains, gaming categories, and general server channels.
Step 4: Customize and Manage Your Server
Review the Setup:

After the bot completes the setup, review the server structure.
Ensure all desired categories and channels have been created.
Add Roles and Permissions:

Assign roles (e.g., Admin, Moderator, Member) and set up permissions for each role across the categories and channels.
You may want to restrict certain channels to specific roles, especially in the Admin & Mod Channels section.
Invite Friends and Community Members:

Share your server invite link with friends or your community to start building your server's population.
Customize your server invite settings (e.g., invite link expiration, max number of uses).
Additional Customizations:

You can further customize the server by adding bots for moderation, music, or other functionalities.
Update the channel topics, server description, and server icon to match your serverâ€™s theme.
Step 5: Troubleshooting & Support
Bot Issues:

If the bot doesn't respond to the !setup_server command, check if it has the necessary permissions (Manage Channels, Manage Roles, etc.).
Ensure the bot is online and properly added to the server.
Manual Adjustments:

If the bot misses any channels or categories, you can manually create them following the structure outlined in the instructions.
